> It's one thing to like embedded systems and another to be able to make a living out of it!

I get lot of messages on [linkedin](https://www.linkedin.com/in/itankar/) from college students (and professional already in the industry) wanting to understand how to pursue a career in embedded systems. Truth be told, I have been in the field for mere 5 years. My experience is very limited but what I have come to understand is `Embedded Systems` as a field of work is really an Onion that you can go on peeling. You can start off in embedded systems and then head in literally any direction in IT industry. From making user-level applications to designing digital circuits. Everything is possible and it just naturally enables you to do so if you want!

That said, I don't think I'll be able to cover each and every corner of the stream. What I wish to do as part of this note is to give an insight into various pieces of knowledge and skills, that if one is thorough with, can enable him/her/them for a happy and rewarding career. We'll use the cartoon below to navigate.

Lets get the color scheme out of the way:
1. Green - Things one `must know`. Non-negotiable!
2. Blue - Things that are `good to know`. In the sense that it would make life easy!

Now lets think a little on what an `Embedded Systems Engineer` do? Well, they solve problems like all other engineers but here the solution touches upon any number of other engineering branches. For example, if the system in question is electro-mechanical they the engineer is dealing with Electrical and MEchanical components typically controlled by the embedded system. Another example can be that the Engineer has to work with a thermal sensor on a computer motherboard...

Further, the question to ask is what skills and knowledge enables one to be good at embedded systems? Let's reason through that with help of the cartoon above -

## 1. Coding
One needs to program the CPU. Obviously one should be able to code! That said, the next set on questions on this should be what language and to what degree? Let's break that down:
### 1.1 C and Assembly
Embedded system solutions are typically supposed to be small and inexpensive. That said, remember cost savings can be done by having less memory on-board (because manufacturing that is expensive!). What that means then is, the code has to be efficient, tight and as packed as possible. You cannot go below raw `Assembly` in terms of trying to achieve minimum number of instructions for a given optimized algorithm to the solution. Next best language for extremely tight coding from code size standpoint is `C` (Few people prefer `C++` and use only the subset that overlaps with `C`. This is fine!). It comes as close to assembly as possible. Thus, one should know C! One should be through in the following C concepts:
1. Pointers.
2. Function Pointers.
3. Structures.
4. Bit Manipulation.

While there are other concepts in `C` that one must know, I believe trying to learn the ones listed above force one to learn the rest tby default. Lets beam the focus back the `Assembly`, why is that needed if `C` does the job. The answer to this is that a given processor may provide certain instructions that the compiler cannot infer from the `C` code directly. And in cases like that you either write a function in Assembly that can be called from C code. An example of this can be `memory barrier` instructions, `cache maintenance operations`, `enable/disable interrupts` etc. Knowing the following about assembly programming helps:
1. Functions in Assembly.
2. Syntax of assembly language.
3. ISA of the processor one is working with.

Having an idea about how the compilation process works can come in handy when debugging the solution.Following are overlapping concepts/ideas that I should know which can help:
1. Inline assembly in C.
2. Assembly function, called from C code.
3. Procedure call standard.
4. Linker scripts and section placement.

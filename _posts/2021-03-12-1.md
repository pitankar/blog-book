> It's one thing to like embedded systems and another to be able to make a living out of it!

I get lot of messages on [linkedin](https://www.linkedin.com/in/itankar/) from college students (and professional already in the industry) wanting to understand how to pursue a career in embedded systems. Truth be told, I have been in the field for mere 5 years. My experience is very limited but what I have come to understand is `Embedded Systems` as a field of work is really an Onion that you can go on peeling. You can start of in embedded systems and then head in literally any direction in IT industry. From making user-level applications to designing digital circuits. Everything is possible and it just naturally enables you to do so if you want!

That said, I don't think I'll be able to cover each and every corner of the stream. What I wish to do as part of this note is to give an insight into various pieces of knowledge and skills, that if one is thorough with, can enable him/her/them for a happy and rewarding career. We'll use the cartoon below to navigate.

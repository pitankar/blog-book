title: A Note to reader!

To live in the world with limited `information` and `control` on all the things that can have an effect (`good` or `bad`) on you with or without you being the cause of it, is a stressful affair! This Blog is collection of notes taken by me on just about anything that I found myself thinking too much on.
The opinion expressed in the notes is my own and usually a result of me thinking too deeply when alone (and scared).

I use writing as a way to slow down my thinking. Usually, intention is to grab something of worth, something that helps me improve as a human, learn more about how I and the world operate or (usually) correct my model of the world.

I hope you find these helpful.
